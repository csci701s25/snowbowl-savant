## Ethics Protocol

**Goal:** Develop an open-source algorithm and free iOS application that allows users to identify mountain ranges and peaks using their phone camera

### Point and Shoot Rational
We envision having a simple, clutter free interface. Our app will consist solely of the function that implements the algorithm. That means our app will not have authentication/profiles, friends, saving, etc. At it's core, this approach comes from personal reflection about the relationship Aidan and I want to have with our devices. We spend excessive amounts of time on our devices adding friends, doom scrolling, or in competition with others. Thus we want this app to serve our needs as hikers and nature enjoyers rather than have us serve the application as users. In addition, from experiences with our friends and family, complex and cluttered apps often elude older and younger generations, so having the app be as simple as it is also makes it more accessible to all ages and demographics.
- Reduce unnecessary time spent on screens
- Accessible to people of all ages (not barred by confusions/hindrances of making accounts, etc.)
- Save database storage (environmental reasons)

#### Possible Futures:
- **Positive**: our app is accessible to all age demographics
- **Positive**: people get to accurately identify mountains for hiking or curiosity reasons
- **Negative**: hidden gem hikes and mountain peaks may become more crowded
- **Negative**: we alienate android users

#### Stakeholders:
- iOS users
- Android users
- Hikers
- Nature enthusiasts

#### Values at Play:
- Personal Screen Time
- Environmental Consciousness
- Accessibility

### Open-Source Rational
Conducting the research for this project, we were surprised to find no open-source code for apps like PeakFinder. We were able to find some bits and pieces that addressed adjacent issues but not compiled repository. There are several scholarly papers on the subject that are inaccessible and or esoteric. So we wanted to create an open-source repository for the application to help our fellow developers reference and build upon the peak detection software.

#### Possible Futures:
- **Positive**: future developers improve the algorithm
- **Positive**: future developers reference the algorithm in adjacent projects
- **Positive**: future developers implement the algorithm into their own peak detection applications
- **Positive**: people who may not be able to access or understand the scholarly papers will have another frame of reference for their projects
- **Negative**: our algorithm does not get used or referenced
- **Negative**: the detection algorithm gets easily repurposed to malicious ends

#### Stakeholders:
- Students
- Professionals
- Academics
- App developers
- Computer scientists

#### Values at Play:
- Sharing of knowledge
- Pursuit of knowledge
- Accessibility
